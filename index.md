This project is private and therefore is unavailable for access. System to detecting malicious domains using techniques for natural language processing.

**Natural Language Understanding**: Understanding natural language or interpreting natural language is a subtopic of natural language processing in artificial intelligence that deals with understanding machine reading. In this case, it can be used to detect textual patterns in the creation of malicious urls.

This project is private and therefore is unavailable for access. System to classify malicious files using disassembled methods combined with machine learning and time series analysis. 

**CNN Long Short-Term Memory Network**: CNN LSTM for short is an LSTM architecture designed for sequence prediction problems, as image or video. The CNN+LSTM architecture involves Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and LSTMs.

### Ransomware Detection using Machine Learning Models and Ensemble Methods
<img src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pip"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-tensorflow-orange"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-keras-red"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-xgboost-yellowgreen">

This project is private and therefore is unavailable for access. Here, reverse engineering techniques are used to extract characteristics from possibly malicious executable files. We use techniques to analyze and create a static detection method based only on the characteristics of malicious files, without using behavioral analysis.

**Ensemble Methods**: this is a technique for combining several different models and thus producing improved results. These methods are commonly used to produce accurate solutions through a combined vote, which considers the result of several models at the same time.

This project is private and therefore is unavailable for access. Here, we use techniques to extract features from .apk files, extension of applications for android systems. Several machine learning models were used and combined using essemble methods to increase the accuracy of the models and decrease the rate of false positives.

This project is private and therefore is unavailable for access. In this project, computer vision techniques are used combined with the power of deep neural networks to detect false sites through images. 

**Object Detection**: Object detection is a technology used in computer vision to detect instances of objects in image. Here we use it to detect important features on fake pages.

### Data Analysis: Global terrorism Open In Kaggle
[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](ttps://www.kaggle.com/vitorgamalemos/an-analysis-of-terrorism-around-the-world) <img src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pip"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-matplotlib-blueviolet"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-seaborn%20-yellowgreen">

This project uses a database on global terrorism between 1970-2017. In this analysis, I separated the most common types of terrorism by territory, including an infographic and details of attacks in the United States. The database contains more than 180,000 Terrorist Attacks.

### Data Analysis: Boston crimes visualization
 [![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](https://www.kaggle.com/vitorgamalemos/visualization-boston-crimes) <img src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pip"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-matplotlib-blueviolet"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-seaborn%20-yellowgreen">

Crime incident reports are provided by Boston Police Department (BPD) to document the initial details surrounding an incident to which BPD officers respond. This is a dataset containing records from the new crime incident report system, which includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident as well as when and where it occurred. This project is an analysis related to these reports of crimes occurred in Boston.

### Data Analysis: Global temperature
[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](https://www.kaggle.com/vitorgamalemos/is-global-temperature-rising) <img src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pip"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-matplotlib-blueviolet"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-seaborn%20-yellowgreen">

Global warming is one of the most debated subjects by scientists. Global warming is the long-term rise in the average temperature of the earth. So far, a lot of data proves that this is happening, but does it is true? This project has a complete analysis of global temperature using climate change data collected since 1750.

My complete implementation project about generative adversarial networks.

<div style="text-align: justify"> A system that learns how to generate new image data with the same statistics as the training set. First, I used the MNIST dataset training base, a database of handwritten digits commonly used to train various image processing systems. I used the same technique to generate images in other contexts, such as faces. </div>
