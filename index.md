This project is private and therefore is unavailable for access. System to detecting malicious domains using techniques for natural language processing.

**Natural Language Understanding**: Understanding natural language or interpreting natural language is a subtopic of natural language processing in artificial intelligence that deals with understanding machine reading. In this case, it can be used to detect textual patterns in the creation of malicious urls.

This project is private and therefore is unavailable for access. System to classify malicious files using disassembled methods combined with machine learning and time series analysis. 

**CNN Long Short-Term Memory Network**: CNN LSTM for short is an LSTM architecture designed for sequence prediction problems, as image or video. The CNN+LSTM architecture involves Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and LSTMs.

This project is private and therefore is unavailable for access. Here, reverse engineering techniques are used to extract characteristics from possibly malicious executable files. We use techniques to analyze and create a static detection method based only on the characteristics of malicious files, without using behavioral analysis.

My complete implementation project about generative adversarial networks.

<div style="text-align: justify"> A system that learns how to generate new image data with the same statistics as the training set. First, I used the MNIST dataset training base, a database of handwritten digits commonly used to train various image processing systems. I used the same technique to generate images in other contexts, such as faces. </div>

<img src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pip"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-tensorflow-orange"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-keras-red">

An implementation project about generative adversarial networks applied in generating anime faces. 

<div style="text-align: justify"> A system that learns how to generate new image data with the same statistics as the training set. In context, I used the anime face dataset to generate random faces using a GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks). The database used for this project can be found on Kaggle. </div>
