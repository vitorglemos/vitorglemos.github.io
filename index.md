My complete implementation project about generative adversarial networks.

<div style="text-align: justify"> A system that learns how to generate new image data with the same statistics as the training set. First, I used the MNIST dataset training base, a database of handwritten digits commonly used to train various image processing systems. I used the same technique to generate images in other contexts, such as faces. </div>
